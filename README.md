## Happy Suiversary!

To celebrate Suiversary, I organize a community exclusive event to mine Suiversary NFT that's limited! Only 100 total supply!

### Quick start

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
2. Create an `.env` file with content of `.env.example`. Fill out your mnemonics.

> It's recommended to run with a new wallet, and just add some SUI for gas fee 
 (_maybe you need at least 10 SUI_).

3. Run `pnpm mine` to start mining. Happy mining!
